A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design.

There are 3 main categories of Design Patterns:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

## Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

Examples of this type of pattern:
- [[Singleton]]
- [[Factory Method]]
## Structural Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. Structural object patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.

Examples of this type of pattern:
- [[Facade]]
- [[Adapter]]

## Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes. Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.

Examples of this type of pattern:
- [[Command]]
- [[Strategy]]
